# AlphaToe
Applying the deep learning techniques from Alpha Go to play tic-tac-toe

These are the code examples to with my talk, the slide for which are in AlphaToe.pdf

As well as the slides, the file script/policy_gradient.py is a good starting point for the project. All networks are 
built using TensorFlow.

## SetUp

To get running start by creating a virtual env/conda env with tensorFlow installed. Current instructions for this are 
at: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#anaconda-installation

I've also found this useful: https://anaconda.org/jjhelmus/tensorflow

Then run the file file policy_gradient.py

This has been tested with python 2.7 and 3.5
